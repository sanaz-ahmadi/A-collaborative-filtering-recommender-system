<ul>
  <li>Produced an estimate of the rating users might give to an unrated movie based on their preferences and movie features.</li>
  <li>Derived a movie ratings dataset from the MovieLens (ml-latest-small) dataset.</li>
  <li>Calculated the cost of the collaborative filtering algorithm and applied regularization to prevent overfitting.</li>
</ul>


### steps followed by code:
